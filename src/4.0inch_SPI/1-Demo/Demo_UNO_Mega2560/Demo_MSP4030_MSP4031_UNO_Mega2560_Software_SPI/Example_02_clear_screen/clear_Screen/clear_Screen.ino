// IMPORTANT: LCDWIKI_SPI LIBRARY MUST BE SPECIFICALLY
// CONFIGURED FOR EITHER THE TFT SHIELD OR THE BREAKOUT BOARD.

//This program is a demo of clearing screen to display black,white,red,green,blue.

//when using the BREAKOUT BOARD only and using these software spi lines to the LCD,
//if you don't need to control the LED pin,you can set it to 3.3V and set the pin definition to -1.
//other pins can be defined by youself,for example
//pin usage as follow:
//                      CS  DC/RS  RESET  SDI/MOSI  SCK  SDO/MISO  LED    VCC     GND    
//Arduino Uno&Mega2560  10    9      8       11     13      12      5   5V/3.3V   GND 

//Remember to set the pins to suit your display module!
